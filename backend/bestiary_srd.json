A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn\u0027t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can\u0027t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature\u0027s existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature\u0027s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie\u0027s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish\u0027s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie\u0027s benefit.",

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn\u0027t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can\u0027t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature\u0027s existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature\u0027s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie\u0027s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish\u0027s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie\u0027s benefit.",

The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated.

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can\u0027t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\nIf the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 ft. of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.",

The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can\u0027t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.",

If it dies, so does the severed head.\n\nIf the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies.

Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The **severed head** has a speed of 0 feet and the troll\u0027s Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.\nThe troll\u0027s speed is halved if it\u0027s missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can\u0027t benefit from bonuses to speed.",

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the elemental\u0027s space.\nThe elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the elemental\u0027s turns, each target grappled by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength and succeeding.",
