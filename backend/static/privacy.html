      <li><strong>Gameplay data:</strong> characters, sessions, messages, and settings you create in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment data:</strong> transaction hashes, amounts, and the wallet address used to purchase credits.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, device identifiers, app version, and diagnostic logs needed to operate and debug the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>AI Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Your gameplay inputs and related session data are processed by AI models to generate responses.
      This processing may occur on our servers or a provider we use to deliver the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with service providers who help
      us operate the Service (hosting, analytics, payment processing) and only as needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service,
      comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. You can request deletion of your data.

    <ul>
      <li>You can request access, correction, or deletion of your data.</li>
      <li>You can stop using the Service at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable measures to protect data, but no system is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is not intended for children under 13. Do not use the Service if you are under 13.
