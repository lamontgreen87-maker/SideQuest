It appears that Docker Desktop is still not running or accessible. The `docker ps` command failed with the following error:

```
failed to connect to the docker API at npipe:////./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine; check if the path is correct and if the daemon is running: open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

I cannot proceed with building or running Docker containers until Docker Desktop is fully functional on your system. Please ensure Docker Desktop is started and accessible, and then let me know when you're ready for me to continue.
