I'm unable to proceed with fixing the 502 error on your pod server. The Docker Desktop application on your machine is currently unable to start, which is a prerequisite for building and running the Docker container.

The error message indicates a problem with Docker Desktop's integration with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), specifically with unmounting a WSL VHDX or an execution error with `wslexec`. This is a system-level issue that I cannot resolve directly through commands.

To fix this, you will need to manually troubleshoot and restart your Docker Desktop application and ensure its WSL backend is functioning correctly. Once Docker Desktop is running without issues, please let me know, and I can resume working on the 502 error.

Here's the relevant error from Docker:
```
Error response from daemon: Docker Desktop is unable to start
terminating main distribution: un-mounting data disk: unmounting WSL VHDX: running wslexec: An error occurred while running the command. DockerDesktop/Wsl/ExecError: c:\windows\system32\wsl.exe --unmount docker_data.vhdx: exit status 0xffffffff (stderr: , wslErrorCode: DockerDesktop/Wsl/ExecError)
```
Please let me know once Docker Desktop is fully functional.
